<h2>Community assembly and dynamics of tropical trees</h2>
<p>How tropical forest tree communities are assembled from species pool? Numerous hypotheses have been proposed to explain patterns of diversity in tropical tree communities. For example, we showed that <a href="http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1365-2745.2011.01937.x/full">soil fertility works as a strong habitat filter</a> for a tropical forest tree community. A long-term goal of this work is to create a more quantitative approach for understanding community assembly rules and for predicting future biodiversity.</p>

<p>The composition of natural communities is changing as species respond to multiple anthropogenic drivers. We are contrasting multiple-level (i.e., species, communityâ€¦) analyses of change in the functional composition in tropical forests to gain mechanistic understanding of forest responses.</p>

<h2>Leaf functional diversity</h2>
<p>Across the global flora, photosynthetic and metabolic rates depend more strongly on leaf area than leaf mass. In contrast, intraspecific variation in these rates is strongly mass-dependent. This inconstancy poses a fundamental question for ecophysiologists, as well as challenge for accurately representing leaf function in dynamic global vegetation models (DVGMs).</p>

<p>We are developing <a href="http://biorxiv.org/content/early/2017/03/22/116855">new quantitative framework</a> to understand causes and consequences of leaf trait variation.</p>
