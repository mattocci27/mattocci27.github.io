# **Masatoshi Katabuchi** (片渕正紀)

I am an Associate Professor at [Xishuangbanna Tropical Botanical Garden](http://english.xtbg.cas.cn/) (XTBG), [Chinese Academy of Sciences](http://english.cas.cn/) (CAS). My research focuses on using functional traits and statistical and simulation models to better understand forest (or any kind of) diversity, including how they respond to climate change.
