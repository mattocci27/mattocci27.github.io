# **Masatoshi Katabuchi** (片渕正紀)

I am a post-doc at [Kellogg Biological Station](http://www.kbs.msu.edu) at [Michigan State University](https://msu.edu). My research focuses on using functional traits and statistical and simulation models to better understand forest (or any kind of) diversity, including how they respond to climate change.
