  abstract = {Abstract Hydraulic failure caused by severe drought contributes to aboveground dieback and whole-plant death. The extent to which dieback or whole-plant death can be predicted by plant hydraulic traits has rarely been tested among species with different leaf habits and/or growth forms. We investigated 19 hydraulic traits in 40 woody species in a tropical savanna and their potential correlations with drought response during an extreme drought event during the El Ni\~no\textendash Southern Oscillation in 2015. Plant hydraulic trait variation was partitioned substantially by leaf habit but not growth form along a trade-off axis between traits that support drought tolerance versus avoidance. Semi-deciduous species and shrubs had the highest branch dieback and top-kill (complete aboveground death) among the leaf habits or growth forms. Dieback and top-kill were well explained by combining hydraulic traits with leaf habit and growth form, suggesting integrating life history traits with hydraulic traits will yield better predictions.},

  abstract = {Vulnerability curves (VCs) describe the loss of hydraulic conductance against increasing xylem tension, providing valuable insights about the response of plant water transport to water stress. Techniques to construct VCs have been developed and modified continuously, but controversies continue. We compared VCs constructed using the bench-top dehydration (BD), air-injection-flow (AI), pneumatic-air-discharge (PAD), optical (OP) and X-ray-computed microtomography (MicroCT) methods for tropical trees and lianas with contrasting vessel lengths. The PAD method generated highly vulnerable VCs, the AI method intermediate VCs, whereas the BD, OP and MicroCT methods produced comparable and more resistant VCs. Vessel-length and diameter accounted for the overestimation ratio of vulnerability estimated using the AI but not the PAD method. Compared with directly measured midday embolism levels, the PAD and AI methods substantially overestimated embolism, whereas the BD, MicroCT and OP methods provided more reasonable estimations. Cut-open vessels, uncertainties in maximum air volume estimations, sample-length effects, tissue cracks and shrinkage together may impede the reliability of the PAD method. In conclusion, we validate the BD, OP and MicroCT methods for tropical plants, whereas the PAD and AI need further mechanistic testing. Therefore, applications of VCs in estimating plant responses to drought need to be cautious.},

  abstract = {Over the past three decades, there has been a concerted effort to study the long-term dynamics of tropical forests throughout the world. Data regarding temporal trends in species diversity, species composition, and species-specific demographic rates have now been amassed. Such data can be utilized to test predictions regarding the roles the environment and demographic stochasticity play in driving forest dynamics. These analyses could be further refined by quantifying the temporal trends in the functional composition and diversity in tropical forests. For example, we have only a handful of studies that quantify directional shifts in the functional composition in tropical forests in response to global change drivers. The present study uses data from three censuses spanning 30 yr in a Neotropical dry forest dynamics plot to provide novel insights into how the functional diversity and composition of a tropical forest has changed through time. Specifically, here we aim to (1) quantify population dynamics and compare it to that expected from environmental or demographic variance; (2) quantify long-term trends in species richness and functional diversity; (3) test whether there have been directional changes in the functional composition of the forest though time and the population changes that are responsible for these changes; and (4) place these long-term results into the context of the successional and climatic history of the forest.},

	abstract = {The relationship between β-diversity and latitude still remains to be a core question in ecology because of the lack of consensus between studies. One hypothesis for the lack of consensus between studies is that spatial scale changes the relationship between latitude and β-diversity. Here, we test this hypothesis using tree data from 15 large-scale forest plots (greater than or equal to 15 ha, diameter at breast height >= 1 cm) across a latitudinal gradient (3{\textendash}30o) in the Asia-Pacific region. We found that the observed β-diversity decreased with increasing latitude when sampling local tree communities at small spatial scale (grain size <=0.1 ha), but the observed β-diversity did not change with latitude when sampling at large spatial scales (greater than or equal to 0.25 ha). Differences in latitudinal β-diversity gradients across spatial scales were caused by pooled species richness (γ-diversity), which influenced observed β-diversity values at small spatial scales, but not at large spatial scales. Therefore, spatial scale changes the relationship between β-diversity, γ-diversity and latitude, and improving sample representativeness avoids the γ-dependence of β-diversity.},
