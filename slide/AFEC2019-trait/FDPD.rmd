# Community Assembly and Species Coexistence

For over a century, filed ecologist have been characterizing patterns in ecological communities and trying to draw theoretical inferences form the resulting data.

--

## Central Questions:

- Why do species occurs at the particular places?

--

- Why do some pairs of species coexist while others not?

--

## Predictions:

- **Environmental filtering**: Ecologically similar species should coexist in ecologically similar environments.

--

- **Limiting similarity**: Ecologically dissimilar species should coexist because too similar species competing for the same resources cannot stably coexist.

# Assuming closely related species are more ecologically similar

## Genus:species ratio: Relatedness as a substitute for ecological similarity

--

Community with 3 genus and 3 species (3:3) vs community with 1 genus and 3 species (1:3)

--

- A high genus:species ratio indicates distantly related and ecologically
  dissimilar species coexist.

    - Limiting similarity

--

- A low genus:species ratio indicates closely related and ecologically
  similar species coexist.

    - Environmental filtering

# Genus:species ratio

.footnote[
[1] Swenson, N. G. The assembly of tropical tree communities - the advances and shortcomings of phylogenetic and functional trait analyses. Ecography 36, 264–276 (2013).
]

- The genus:species ratio type of study in plant community ecology started ~1910
  and was popular until 1990's

--

- A large criticism of genus:speices ratio analyses is that they do not take
  acount for the different ages of genera and species
    - Two species in a relatively young genus may be expected to be more similar than two species in a relatively old genus.

# Competitive hierarchy

## Limiting similarity

Competitive interaction strengths between species will increase with decreasing niche distance, measured as their absolute traits distance $|t_A - t_B|$

## Competitive hierarchy

Competitive effect of species A on species B will increase with increasing $t_A - t_B$.

# Summary `r emo::ji("beer")`


- Why do we use trait and phylogenetic diversity?

  - We want to quantify ecological similarities of species and multiple dimension of
    biodiversity
--

- Trait-based approaches

  - They will make "ecology" more quantitative and predictive

--

- How to calculate trait and phylogenetic diversity?

  - I hope you remember it!
